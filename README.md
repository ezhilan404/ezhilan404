# 👾 Ezhilan — Cybersecurity & Offensive Security Enthusiast
🔐 3rd year B.Tech CSE (Cyber Physical Systems) @ VIT Chennai  
🕵️‍♂️ Red Team / Network Security / Ethical Hacking  
🛠 I like **building security tools**, not just using them  
🌐 Portfolio: **https://ezhilan404.github.io/ezhilan-lab**

## 🧠 About Me
I break things to understand how they work — and then build them better.  
I’m interested in offensive security, red-team simulations, and designing tools that automate security testing.

Currently learning deeper:
- Network internals & packet manipulation
- Exploit development & buffer overflows
- Reverse engineering fundamentals
